# kval-boltdb-demo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kval-access-language/kval-boltdb-demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kval-access-language/kval-boltdb-demo)

Demo code for KVAL (Key Value Access Language) BoltDB bindings. Displays a few
of the features that might be worth looking at for those looking at working
with BoltDB but without having to do too much programming to get it up and
running.

## KVAL and BBolt

KVAL stands for Key Value Access Language and is a specification for
interacting with Bolt-like key value databases to make working with them far
more fluid.

Information on KVAL can be found here: https://github.com/kval-access-language/kval

And a working implementation of the specification for BoltDB can be found here:
